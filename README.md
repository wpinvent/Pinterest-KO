Pinterest-KO
============

Quick experiment to use Knockout.js to recreate a Pinterest-like interface.

##Features:

* Add Tiles
* Remove Tiles (on click)
* Replace removed tile with a lower tile (uses a quick css3 transition animation)


> More comments in index.js.

##TODO:

* Rename index.js
* Add removal to only top right portion of tile (neat x image to come)
